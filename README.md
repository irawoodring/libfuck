### 001: A transcompiler converting a bevy of languages to `Brainfuck`
Let's be real: todays high-level programming languages coddle the developer into a false 
sense of security with silly things like "type safety" and "lexical scoping". True developers
have been burned by the red-hot sun and know that it is only by the scars of the past may you
better yourself. Would Caesar have conquered Rome if the Senate had not besmirched him? Would 
Alexander the Great have conquered the world if his father hadn't told him he was a dissapointment?
The foremost accomplishments of mankind *always* come on the coattails of the sun's sweet kiss, and thus
we can breed better programmers by forcing their code into the `Brainfuck` paradigm. Do it for the flying cars.
Do it for the virtualization of reality. Do it for the memes. 

### 002: A library that obfuscates code for umm... security purposes?

### 003: A library that looks through source code and replaces the f word with PG-13 version.

### 004: A library that looks through source code and replaces PG-13 explicatives with the most holy of utterances - "fuck".

### 005: A Clippy-like persona that lives on your desktop and randomly curses at you when you make a typo.

### 006: A library to change all perror code messages to include "fuck"
